This directory holds information about hardware and usage aspects of the ADC-001 
cape for the Beaglebone.  The ADC-001 is designed and manufactured by Electroniscript, inc.

The ADC-001 is an A/D cape which can take data in either single-sample or in multiple
sampled data mode.  It is designed to work with microphone-level input
signals; the cape includes a high-gain mic amp which brings the input
signal level up to the magnitude required for sampling by an A/D
converter.  A companion microphone, MIC-001, is also available from Electroniscript.
The frequency response of the circuit runs from 50Hz -- 15kHz, so
the unit is well-suited for voice or audio signal processing applications.
Target applications for the ADC-001 include:
-- Sound capture and analysis.
-- Audio signal processing.
-- Audio-frequency data acquisition.
-- Embedded sensors and controllers.
-- DSP algorithm prototyping and development.
-- Education, research, and development.
